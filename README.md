## An attempt at implementing graphical algorithms in Java

#### Pineda's fill algorithm 

Make sure to set the points for this algorithm in counter-clockwise order.
This algoritm only works with convex polygons.



#### Flood fill algorithm with BFS and DFS (with diagonal fill and without)
Can be used to flood the selected area with a color.
May have some problems with single pixel areas.
